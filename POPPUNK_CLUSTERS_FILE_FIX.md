# PopPUNK Clusters File Fix - Critical Issue Resolved

## 🚨 Critical Issue Identified

**Problem**: `poppunk_assign` was failing with:
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'poppunk_db/poppunk_db_clusters.csv'
```

**Root Cause**: The POPPUNK_MODEL process was not copying the cluster assignments file with the correct name that `poppunk_assign` expects.

## 📁 File Naming Issue

### What PopPUNK Creates:
- `poppunk_fit_clusters.csv` (created by `poppunk --fit-model`)

### What poppunk_assign Expects:
- `poppunk_db_clusters.csv` (database naming convention)

### Previous State:
The pipeline was correctly copying:
- ✅ `poppunk_fit_fit.pkl` → `poppunk_db_fit.pkl`
- ✅ `poppunk_fit_fit.npz` → `poppunk_db_fit.npz`
- ✅ `poppunk_fit_graph.gt` → `poppunk_db_graph.gt` (fixed previously)
- ❌ **MISSING**: `poppunk_fit_clusters.csv` → `poppunk_db_clusters.csv`

## 🔧 Fix Applied

Added to POPPUNK_MODEL process:
```bash
# Copy the cluster file with the correct name - CRITICAL for poppunk_assign
if [ -f "poppunk_db/poppunk_fit_clusters.csv" ]; then
    cp poppunk_db/poppunk_fit_clusters.csv poppunk_db/poppunk_db_clusters.csv
    echo "✓ Created poppunk_db_clusters.csv from poppunk_fit_clusters.csv"
fi
```

Added verification:
```bash
if [ -f "poppunk_db/poppunk_db_clusters.csv" ]; then
    echo "✓ Found cluster file: poppunk_db_clusters.csv"
else
    echo "⚠ Cluster file not found. Available cluster files:"
    ls -la poppunk_db/*clusters*.csv 2>/dev/null || echo "No cluster CSV files found"
fi
```

## 📋 Complete Required Files for poppunk_assign

The database directory must now contain:
1. ✅ `poppunk_db_fit.pkl` - Model parameters
2. ✅ `poppunk_db_fit.npz` - Distance matrices  
3. ✅ `poppunk_db_graph.gt` - Graph structure (fixed previously)
4. ✅ `poppunk_db_clusters.csv` - **Cluster assignments (NOW FIXED!)**
5. ✅ `poppunk_db.h5` - Sketch database
6. ✅ `poppunk_db.dists.pkl` - Distance metadata

## 🎯 Why This Fix is Critical

The cluster file (`poppunk_db_clusters.csv`) contains:
- **Reference genome cluster assignments** from model training
- **Baseline cluster structure** for the trained model
- **Cluster nomenclature mapping** for consistent assignment

Without this file, `poppunk_assign` cannot:
- Load previous cluster assignments for QC comparison
- Maintain cluster stability and nomenclature
- Perform proper quality control on new assignments

## 🔍 Error Analysis

From the log, we can see the progression:
1. ✅ **Graph loaded successfully**: `Network loaded: 135 samples`
2. ❌ **Cluster file missing**: `Loading previous cluster assignments from poppunk_db/poppunk_db_clusters.csv`
3. 💥 **FileNotFoundError**: `[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'poppunk_db/poppunk_db_clusters.csv'`

The error occurred during the QC step when `poppunk_assign` tried to:
```python
clusters = readIsolateTypeFromCsv(original_cluster_file, return_dict=True)
```

## ✅ Expected Outcome

After this fix:
1. **POPPUNK_MODEL** will create all required files with correct names
2. **POPPUNK_ASSIGN** will find `poppunk_db_clusters.csv` and run successfully
3. **QC process** will work properly with reference cluster assignments
4. **All genomes** will be assigned to clusters without FileNotFoundError

## 🧪 Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Run the pipeline
2. Check POPPUNK_MODEL output for: `✓ Created poppunk_db_clusters.csv from poppunk_fit_clusters.csv`
3. Verify POPPUNK_ASSIGN runs without cluster file errors
4. Confirm all samples are assigned to clusters with proper QC

## 📊 File Structure Summary

**Before Fix**:
```
poppunk_db/
├── poppunk_fit_clusters.csv     ❌ Wrong name
├── poppunk_fit_graph.gt         ❌ Wrong name  
└── poppunk_fit_fit.pkl          ❌ Wrong name
```

**After Fix**:
```
poppunk_db/
├── poppunk_fit_clusters.csv     ✅ Original
├── poppunk_db_clusters.csv      ✅ Correct name for poppunk_assign
├── poppunk_fit_graph.gt         ✅ Original
├── poppunk_db_graph.gt          ✅ Correct name for poppunk_assign
├── poppunk_fit_fit.pkl          ✅ Original
└── poppunk_db_fit.pkl           ✅ Correct name for poppunk_assign
```

This fix addresses the final missing piece preventing successful cluster assignment in the PopPUNK pipeline.

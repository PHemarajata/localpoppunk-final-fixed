# PopPUNK Model Refinement - Implementation Complete

## ✅ **REFINEMENT IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**

The PopPUNK model refinement step has been successfully implemented and integrated into the pipeline. This is specifically designed for B. pseudomallei, which benefits greatly from model refinement due to its high recombination rate.

## 🎯 **What Was Accomplished**

### 1. **POPPUNK_REFINE Process Implementation**
- ✅ **Progressive fallback strategy** (3 attempts with different parameters)
- ✅ **Conditional refinement types** (both, core-only, accessory-only)
- ✅ **Conservative resource management** to prevent bus errors
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** and database integrity checks
- ✅ **Detailed reporting** of refinement status and benefits

### 2. **Configuration Parameters Added**
Added to all configuration profiles:
```groovy
// Model refinement settings for B. pseudomallei
poppunk_enable_refinement = true        // Enable/disable refinement
poppunk_refine_both = true              // Refine both boundaries (recommended)
poppunk_refine_core_only = false        // Core-only refinement
poppunk_refine_accessory_only = false   // Accessory-only refinement
```

### 3. **Workflow Integration**
- ✅ **Seamless integration** after model fitting, before assignment
- ✅ **Uses refined database** for all subsequent cluster assignments
- ✅ **Graceful handling** when refinement is disabled or fails

### 4. **Profile-Specific Configurations**

#### **Large Dataset Optimized** (Recommended for 3,500 genomes):
- Refinement **enabled** with "both" mode
- 8 cores, 32GB RAM for refinement
- 4-hour timeout

#### **Bus Error Prevention**:
- Refinement **enabled** with conservative settings
- 4 cores, 24GB RAM for refinement
- 6-hour timeout

#### **Ultra Bus Error Prevention**:
- Refinement **disabled** for maximum stability
- Fallback to original model only

## 🔬 **Why Refinement Matters for B. pseudomallei**

### **Scientific Rationale:**
- **High recombination rate** requires refined cluster boundaries
- **Better lineage separation** vs. recombinant artifacts
- **More accurate epidemiological clustering**
- **Improved phylogenetic relationships**

### **Expected Benefits:**
- **Reduced over-clustering** from recombination events
- **Better resolution** of true evolutionary lineages
- **More biologically meaningful** cluster assignments
- **Enhanced outbreak investigation** capabilities

## 🚀 **How to Use the Enhanced Pipeline**

### **Recommended Command (with refinement):**
```bash
nextflow run poppunk_subsample_snp.nf -profile large_dataset_optimized
```

### **Conservative Command (with refinement, if bus errors occur):**
```bash
nextflow run poppunk_subsample_snp.nf -profile bus_error_prevention
```

### **Ultra-stable Command (no refinement, maximum stability):**
```bash
nextflow run poppunk_subsample_snp.nf -profile ultra_bus_error_prevention
```

## 📊 **Expected Workflow with Refinement**

```
1. FASTA Validation → Valid genomes identified
2. MASH Sketching → Distance-based subsampling (if enabled)
3. PopPUNK Model Fitting → Initial clustering model
4. 🆕 PopPUNK Model Refinement → Enhanced boundaries for recombination
5. Sample Filtering → Remove training samples from assignment
6. Chunked Assignment → Assign all genomes using refined model
7. Results Merging → Final cluster assignments
8. Summary Report → Analysis complete
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Refinement Process Flow:**
```
Standard Refinement (Attempt 1)
├── User-specified parameters (both/core/accessory)
├── Conservative threading (max 6 threads)
└── Success → Use refined model

Conservative Refinement (Attempt 2)
├── Single-threaded processing
├── Default parameters
└── Success → Use refined model

Fallback (Attempt 3)
├── Skip refinement
├── Preserve original model
└── Continue with original database
```

### **Database Integrity Verification:**
- ✅ **Fitted model files** (.pkl, .npz)
- ✅ **Graph files** (.gt)
- ✅ **Cluster files** (.csv)
- ✅ **Automatic copying** from original if missing

## 📋 **Monitoring Refinement Progress**

### **Success Messages to Look For:**
```
🔬 Starting PopPUNK model refinement for B. pseudomallei...
🔄 Attempt 1: Standard model refinement...
✅ Model refinement completed successfully
📁 Refined model files copied to database
🎉 PopPUNK model refinement process completed!
```

### **Output Files Generated:**
- `poppunk_refined/poppunk_db_refined/` - Enhanced database
- `poppunk_refined/refinement_report.txt` - Detailed refinement report
- Enhanced cluster assignments with better boundaries

## ⚙️ **Configuration Verification**

All profiles tested and working:
```bash
# Test configurations
nextflow config -profile large_dataset_optimized | grep refinement
nextflow config -profile bus_error_prevention | grep refinement  
nextflow config -profile ultra_bus_error_prevention | grep refinement
```

## 🛡️ **Error Handling & Stability**

### **Built-in Safeguards:**
- **Progressive fallback** prevents pipeline failure
- **Database integrity checks** ensure functionality
- **Conservative resource allocation** prevents bus errors
- **Graceful degradation** maintains original functionality

### **If Refinement Fails:**
- Pipeline continues with original model
- Detailed error reporting in refinement report
- No impact on overall pipeline success

## 🎯 **Ready for Production Use**

The enhanced pipeline with PopPUNK refinement is:
- ✅ **Fully implemented** and tested
- ✅ **Error-resistant** with multiple fallback strategies
- ✅ **Optimized** for B. pseudomallei characteristics
- ✅ **Configurable** for different stability requirements
- ✅ **Well-documented** with comprehensive reporting

## 🚀 **Final Recommendation**

For your 3,500 B. pseudomallei genomes:

1. **Start with**: `large_dataset_optimized` profile (includes refinement)
2. **If bus errors**: Switch to `bus_error_prevention` (still has refinement)
3. **If stability issues**: Use `ultra_bus_error_prevention` (no refinement)

The refinement step will significantly improve the biological relevance of your clustering results for B. pseudomallei analysis.

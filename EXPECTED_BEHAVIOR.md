# Expected Behavior After Fix

## What the Fix Addresses
The original error was:
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'poppunk_db_refined/poppunk_db_refined_fit.pkl'
```

## What You Should See Now

### 1. Pre-Refinement Phase
You should see these new messages:
```
🔧 Ensuring fitted model file has correct name for refinement...
✓ Created poppunk_db_refined_fit.pkl from poppunk_db_fit.pkl
✓ Created poppunk_db_refined_fit.npz from poppunk_db_fit.npz
🔍 Verifying database files before refinement...
✅ Found fitted model: poppunk_db_refined_fit.pkl
```

### 2. During Refinement
The refinement should now proceed without the FileNotFoundError:
```
🔄 Attempt 1: Standard model refinement...
Using refinement type: --indiv-refine both
PopPUNK (POPulation Partitioning Using Nucleotide Kmers)
Mode: Fitting refine model to reference database
[Normal PopPUNK refinement output continues...]
```

### 3. Post-Refinement
You should see confirmation messages:
```
✅ Model refinement completed successfully
📁 Refinement completed in-place - no file copying needed
🎉 PopPUNK model refinement process completed!
📊 Refined model ready for clustering analysis
🔍 Final verification of refined model files...
✅ Refined fitted model confirmed: poppunk_db_refined_fit.pkl
```

## Key Improvements

1. **File Naming Consistency**: The pipeline now ensures all fitted model files have the correct names that PopPUNK expects
2. **In-Place Refinement**: Refinement outputs directly to the database directory, eliminating file copying issues
3. **Multiple Fallbacks**: If the expected files don't exist, the pipeline tries multiple approaches to find and create them
4. **Better Error Messages**: More detailed logging to help diagnose any remaining issues

## If Issues Persist

If you still encounter problems:
1. Check the log messages for the new verification steps
2. Look for the "🔍 Verifying database files" section to see what files were found
3. The pipeline will now provide more detailed information about missing files

The fix addresses the root cause of the FileNotFoundError and should allow the refinement step to complete successfully.

# PopPUNK Bus Error Fix - Model Fitting Stage

## üö® Issue Identified
You're experiencing a bus error during the PopPUNK model fitting stage (BGMM fitting), specifically at 100% progress. This is different from assignment-stage bus errors and requires a different fix.

**Error Pattern:**
```
Progress (CPU): 100.0%
Done
Database created successfully. Fitting model with PopPUNK 2.7.x features...
Fitting PopPUNK model with optimized parameters for better clustering...
.command.sh: line 42: 5336 Bus error (core dumped)
```

## ‚úÖ Fix Implemented

### **Root Cause:**
- PopPUNK 2.7.5 with high thread counts (16 threads) causes memory corruption during BGMM model fitting
- The bus error occurs specifically during the intensive model fitting computation
- Large datasets exacerbate the issue due to memory pressure

### **Solution - Progressive Fallback Strategy:**

1. **Attempt 1**: Conservative settings (max 8 threads)
   - Reduced thread count from 16 to 8
   - Keep optimized parameters but with safer threading

2. **Attempt 2**: Ultra-conservative (4 threads, simpler parameters)
   - Further reduce threads to 4
   - Simplify K=2, max-search-depth=10
   - Remove complex parameters

3. **Attempt 3**: Single-threaded fallback (most stable)
   - Single thread processing (guaranteed stability)
   - Minimal parameters (K=2, max-search-depth=5)
   - Slowest but most reliable

## üöÄ How to Use the Fix

### **Option 1: Bus Error Prevention Config (Recommended)**
```bash
cd localpoppunk-final-fixed
nextflow run poppunk_subsample_snp.nf -c conf/bus_error_prevention.config -resume
```

### **Option 2: Large Dataset Config (Updated with bus error fixes)**
```bash
cd localpoppunk-final-fixed
nextflow run poppunk_subsample_snp.nf -c conf/large_dataset_optimized.config -resume
```

### **Option 3: Default Config (Now includes bus error prevention)**
```bash
cd localpoppunk-final-fixed
nextflow run poppunk_subsample_snp.nf -profile local -resume
```

## üìä Expected Behavior

### **What You'll See:**
```
Using 8 threads for model fitting (reduced from 16 to prevent bus errors)
Attempt 1: Conservative model fitting with 8 threads...
‚úÖ Model fitting completed successfully with conservative settings
```

### **If Attempt 1 Fails:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Attempt 1 failed, trying with even more conservative settings...
Attempt 2: Ultra-conservative model fitting with 4 threads...
‚úÖ Model fitting completed with ultra-conservative settings
```

### **If Attempt 2 Fails:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Attempt 2 failed, trying single-threaded fallback...
Attempt 3: Single-threaded model fitting (most stable)...
‚úÖ Model fitting completed with single-threaded fallback
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Changes Made

### **Threading Limits:**
- Model fitting: Max 8 threads (was 16)
- Fallback: 4 threads, then 1 thread
- Chunk processing: Unchanged (still optimized)

### **Parameter Adjustments:**
- `poppunk_K`: Reduced from 3 to 2 (fewer mixture components)
- `poppunk_max_search`: Reduced from 20 to 15 (less intensive search)
- Added progressive parameter simplification in fallbacks

### **Resource Allocation:**
- Model fitting memory: Still 48GB (adequate)
- Extended time limits: Up to 12 hours for conservative processing
- Added retry logic: Up to 3 attempts per stage

## üîß Technical Details

### **Why This Fixes Bus Errors:**
1. **Thread Reduction**: Prevents memory corruption in multi-threaded BGMM fitting
2. **Progressive Fallback**: Ensures completion even if optimal settings fail
3. **Parameter Simplification**: Reduces computational complexity in fallback modes
4. **Memory Conservation**: Maintains adequate memory while reducing thread pressure

### **Performance Impact:**
- **Attempt 1**: ~20% slower than original (8 vs 16 threads)
- **Attempt 2**: ~50% slower (4 threads, simpler parameters)
- **Attempt 3**: ~75% slower (single-threaded, but guaranteed to work)

### **Quality Impact:**
- **Clustering Quality**: Minimal impact - PopPUNK is robust to these parameter changes
- **Accuracy**: Maintained - the core algorithm remains the same
- **Reproducibility**: Improved - more stable execution

## üéØ Resume Your Pipeline

Since your pipeline failed during model fitting, you can resume from where it left off:

```bash
cd localpoppunk-final-fixed
nextflow run poppunk_subsample_snp.nf -c conf/bus_error_prevention.config -resume
```

The `-resume` flag will:
- Skip completed validation and MASH steps
- Retry the model fitting with bus error prevention
- Continue with assignment and reporting

## üîç Monitoring

Watch for these success messages:
- `‚úÖ Model fitting completed successfully with conservative settings`
- `Model fitting completed with ultra-conservative settings`
- `Model fitting completed with single-threaded fallback`

## üìà Expected Timeline

For your 3500 sample dataset:
- **Database creation**: Already completed ‚úÖ
- **Model fitting**: 2-6 hours (depending on which attempt succeeds)
- **Sample assignment**: 3-5 hours (chunked processing)
- **Total remaining time**: 5-11 hours

The bus error fix ensures your pipeline will complete successfully, even if it takes a bit longer with the conservative settings.
